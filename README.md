<h1>Welcome To Kingdomino</h1>

<p>This product is being created for CEN3032 as Group 4â€™s semester project. It is a self-contained product. The product created by this project will serve to entertain the player as they try to build their kingdom with dominos and gain the most amount of points. The player will act as a lord seeking new lands to expand their kingdom. There are different kinds of lands, including wheat fields, lakes, and mountains. Players will compete with other lords to acquire these lands.</p>
 
<p>This game uses two tiles that create a domino. WIth each turn, each player will select a new domino to add to their existing kingdom, making sure that at least one side connects to a matching terrain type. The order of which player picks first depends on which domino the player picked last, with better dominos forcing players to pick later in the next round. The game will end when a player has completed a 5x5 grid, and points are based on the number of connecting environments and valuable crown symbols.</p>
