Doesn't ignore bin and obj folders:
I am on VS 2015 Update 3.

@swapnildaga17

I know this is late. but might help someone
@tejpratapsingh
If you have already added the bin and obj folders in git. you will have to remove them since git ignore does not work on files already in git

use command

git rm -r --cached <path to bin, obj folders>
git commit -m "untracking bin and obj"

now the gitignore works on bin and obj

@Genebi Use the ! (Not) operator.

!path/filename

@kmorcinek The following commands also work for downloading when using Git for Windows:

curl -LOf http://gist.githubusercontent.com/kmorcinek/2710267/raw/.gitignore

@vishwasgupta you need to delete them all and then make a commit that deletes them.

kmorcinek commented on Apr 21, 2019
@Genebi you can also add one file explicit, like:
git add -f my/ignore/file.foo
